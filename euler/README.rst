Project Euler
_____________

This repository hosts my personal solutions to Project Euler questions. 
This repository is intended to be used to help with ideas in writing your own 
solutions. It is the best to solve the problem first before looking at others code. 
While it is not always easy to have an optimized solution at first, going through the 
motions of creating a working algorithm is much more important. After you've solved the problem (you can check if you got it right on the Project Euler website), then you can see if my solutions might help you optimize further.

My solutions are by no means optimized. They are a work in progress, but I figure they could be beneficial to others. Send in a pull request if you have an improvement. I am always interested to see how others approach these problems.
