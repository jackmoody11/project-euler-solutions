# Project Euler
_____________

This repo hosts my personal solutions to Project Euler questions. 
This repo is intended to help with ideas after writing your own 
solutions.

It is the best to solve the problem first before looking at the code here. While it is not always easy to have an optimized solution at first, creating a working algorithm is the primary goal. After you've solved the problem (you can check if you got it right on the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net)), then you can see if my solutions might help you optimize further.


My solutions are by **no** means optimized. They are a work in progress. 

Send in a pull request if you have an improvement (faster or simpler). I am always interested to see how others approach these problems.
